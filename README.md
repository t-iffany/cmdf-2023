# ZenZone 3D

An interactive 3D game focused on mental health and wellness, while providing a relaxing and calm atmosphere. Users can type in their problems and AI will output an affirmation that reframes their stressor in a more positive or constructive way. Users can move their avatar around to explore the 3D environment and also opt-in for a text notification reminder to revisit the game - "Are you stressed? Visit ZenZone!"
